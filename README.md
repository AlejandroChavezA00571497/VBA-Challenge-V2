# VBA-Challenge-V2
Module 2 Challenge for the Tec de Monterrey Data Analysis Bootcamp, focusing on VBA Scripting Version 2


This VBA Script loops through all sheets in an Excel document,
outputting a summary of tickers with their Yearly Change in value of a
stock, Percent Change in value of a stock and Total Stock Volume, as
well as a section with the Greatest % increase, descrease and Greatest
Total Value in each year.

The .bas file can be downloaded, opened with any text editor, and copied
into a module of the VBA Editor inside any Excel file with the stock
data organized in the structure of the activity.

The screenshots are provided as proof of the result of running the .bas file on the provided excel file.
